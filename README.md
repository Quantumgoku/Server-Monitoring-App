# Server Monitoring App

This application continuously monitors servers by pinging them in real-time and updating the database. It also generates a report for a particular day interval.

## Features

- **Real-Time Server Monitoring**: The app pings servers in real-time and updates the database with the status of each server.
- **Report Generation**: Generates a report of server status for a particular day interval.

## Future Development

- **Server Information**: Add a functionality to gather information about a given server. This would determine if the given IP is of a server, switch, or router.
- **Visual Reports**: Provide a visual representation for the generated reports.
- **Python File Optimization**: Optimize the Python file for better performance.
- **ICMP Packet Functionality**: Add a functionality to send ICMP packets to a particular server to check which ports are open, thus knowing the possible services running on them.
